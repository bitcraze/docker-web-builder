# Menu support Plugin

This plugin adds liquid support for menus.

## side_menu

This tag renders a side menu in the style that is used in the repository documentation. If it finds a `_data/menu.yml`
file, this will be used to define the menu. If no file is found, the menu structure will be generated from the file
tree.

See the code documentation for examples

## sub_page_menu

This tag renders a menu showing the contents of a directory. It is intended to be used in an index.md file in a directory.
